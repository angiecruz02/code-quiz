# JavaScript Quiz Game

This project is a JavaScript quiz game designed for coding boot camp students to test their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. The game includes a timer, multiple-choice questions, and a high score feature.

## User Story

As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Features

The JavaScript Quiz Game includes the following features:

1. Start Button: Clicking the start button initiates the quiz and starts the timer.

2. Timer: The timer begins counting down as soon as the quiz starts. The remaining time is displayed on the screen.

3. Question Display: Each question is presented one at a time after clicking the start button. The user selects an answer from the provided options.

4. Answer Validation: After selecting an answer, the game validates whether it is correct or incorrect. If the answer is correct, the user proceeds to the next question. If the answer is incorrect, time is subtracted from the timer.

6. High Score Saving: After the game is over, the user can save their initials and score. The high score is stored and can be viewed later.
